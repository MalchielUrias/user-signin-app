# User Signin App
This application creates a secure way to authenticate requests to REST API using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

When two systems (applications or services) need to exchange data, there is a need for the systems to authenticate and identify themselves. You can use a JSON Web Token to identify your user without 
sending private credentials on every request. 

If you apply this concept to a REST API, youâ€™ll see how our client-server interactions can benefit from these mechanics. 

Our user signin-app shows how this project works by demonstrating the user sign-up process and login process.
